        <h2>Why Won't Students Come to Labs?</h2>

        <p>Why won't students come to labs? This is something I always ponder. After unprepared students write exams, They watch their marks in wonder.</p>
        <p>Why won't students come to labs? What is more important than class? How can you be a student if you don't even try to pass?
        </p>
        <p>Why won't students come to labs? It happens all the time. If you came to labs, you'd know what to do. But you would rather duck and go lime.
        </p>
        <p>Why won't students come to labs? I see them all now stressing. If you only learned this basic programming, You would surely now be zessing.
